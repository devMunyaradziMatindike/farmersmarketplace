            <p>Musika Wedu respects IP rights and has a formal procedure to handle claims of infringement. If you believe content on the Platform infringes your registered or unregistered IP rights, please follow the steps below.</p>
            
            <h3>7.1 How to Send a Notice of Alleged Infringement</h3>
            <p>Send email to <a href="mailto:info@nessosystems.co.zw">info@nessosystems.co.zw</a> with subject "IP Infringement Notice — Musika Wedu" and include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your full name, postal address, email and telephone number.</li>
                <li>A clear identification of the work/type of IP you claim is infringed (e.g., registered trade mark, registered copyright work, domain, logo). Provide registration details if available (trade mark registration number, copyright registration where applicable).</li>
                <li>The location of the infringing material on Musika Wedu (exact URL(s) or screenshots).</li>
                <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use is not authorised by the IP owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
                <li>A statement, made under penalty of perjury or equivalent, that the information in the notice is accurate and you are the owner or authorised to act for the owner of the IP right.</li>
                <li>Your electronic or physical signature (typed name is acceptable for initial notice).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Acknowledgement & handling timeline:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days.</li>
                <li>We will review and, where appropriate, remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material within 14 business days of a valid notice, or sooner if required by law or where the claim appears prima facie valid. We may also suspend the account of repeat infringers pending investigation.</li>
                <li>If the notice is incomplete we will request further information; invalid notices will be rejected with reasons.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Zimbabwe does not operate a literal "DMCA" regime; however, Musika Wedu voluntarily follows a notice-and-takedown procedure consistent with international best practice and the Trade Marks and Copyright statutes where enforcement remedies are available.</p>
            
            <h3>7.2 Counter-notice / Response by the Content Uploader</h3>
            <p>If your content has been removed after a notice and you believe it was removed in error (e.g., you are the rights owner or have a licence), submit a Counter-Notice to <a href="mailto:info@nessosystems.co.zw">info@nessosystems.co.zw</a> with:</p>
            <ol>

                <li>Identification of the removed content and the location where it appeared.</li>
                <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification.</li>

                <li>Your signature (electronic signature acceptable).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice we will: (a) provide the original claimant with a copy of the counter-notice, and (b) restore the content after 14 business days unless the claimant provides evidence that they have initiated a court action to restrain the uploader. (We may vary timelines in exceptional cases, e.g., for urgent court orders or statutory notices.)</p>

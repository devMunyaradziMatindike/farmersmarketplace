            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li>Zimbabwe's <strong>Cyber & Data Protection Act</strong> and <strong>SI 155/2024</strong> require lawful processing, appropriate safeguards, registration (where required) and appointing a Data Protection Officer for controllers meeting the threshold. SI 155 also sets out breach-notification duties.</li>
                <li>There is currently no standalone "cookie law" in Zimbabwe similar to the EU ePrivacy Directive, but data protection rules apply to personal data derived from cookies. Legal commentators therefore recommend obtaining consent for non-essential cookies as best practice. (That is the approach Musika Wedu takes.)</li>
                <li>POTRAZ and local practitioners have emphasised transparency, consent records, and readiness to notify in case of a breach. We will follow that approach.</li>

            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                If you accept, we store a consent record (which cookie categories you accepted, date/time, your IP and device fingerprint) for audit and compliance. We recommend retaining consent logs for at least 5 years (or as required by SI 155 / POTRAZ guidance).

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                You can change or withdraw consent at any time using the cookie preference link in the site footer or by clearing cookies in your browser. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to withdrawal.

                Musika Wedu uses selected third-party providers (edge/CDN, analytics, maps). When you interact with embedded third-party content (maps, videos, WhatsApp click-to-chat), those providers may set cookies. Their practices are governed by their own privacy/cookie policies and not by Musika Wedu. Examples include: CDN providers for images, mapping service for location features, analytics tools, and payment providers (if/when enabled). You should review those third-party policies for details.
